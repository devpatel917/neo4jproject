In this project, we will perform the following:

* Query CSSR chapter and disease data into the neo4j graph database (each source node represents the chapter and the children are the CCSR categories under the chapter)

The goal of this project is to provide a data transformation from a list of CSSR chapters and diseases to a graph data structure
